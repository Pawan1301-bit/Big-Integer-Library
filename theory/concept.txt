--> When to use const ??
using const indicates that the  function does  not modify the object passed to it. If it used for parameters that means it should not be changed by the function 

--> why we use friend func(BigInt &) ??
using this indicates that we pass the object of BigInt by reference means any change in the value of orignal object that passed 

-->why in pre increment/decrement we pass the value by reference and not in post
pre increment/ decrement passing value by refrence allow the user to modify the value before using while in post we do not want to modify this before using 

--> can we implement the constructor outside the class 
after defining the constructor inside the class we can  implement it outside the class
