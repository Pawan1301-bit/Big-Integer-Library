In c++ we have different types of datatypes which are used to store value 
for storing the numeric value we have int, long and long long 
1.) >int --> -2^31 to 2^31 -1
2.) long --> It is typically of 32 bit on 32 bit system 
    size -- 32 bit system --> -2^32 to 2^32 - 1
         -- 64 bit system --> -2^63 to 2^63 - 1
3.)long long -->  It is 64 bit in all the system 
    size -- 32 bit system --> -2^63 to 2^63 - 1
         -- 64 bit system --> -2^63 to 2^63 - 1

for using this data types we have include <climits> as out header file 

so we can store in maximum of 20 digit so to deal with numbers larger than 20 digits we  will design a new data type which is called bigInt which will store the number greater than them

-->Why do we need a BigInt ??
Unlike java which has a standard library a robust bigInteger which provides arbitrary-precision integers and a wide range of mathematical opertions but in c++ we have a limit range of value so we have the need of a BigInt

Operation we are going to implement on our bigInt datatypes are 
-> Addition of  2 big interger 
-> Subtract of  2 big interger
-> Multiply of  2 big interger
-> Division of  2 big interger
-> Modulo   of  2 big interger
-> raise to the power of big integer
-> square root of a big integer 
-> comparision between 2 big integer 2 check which one is greater or smaller
-> find the number of digits in the big integer
-> print the big integer
-> convert a integer to big integer

Application of bigInt
--> find the factorial
--> find the fibomacci series 
--> find the catalan number
